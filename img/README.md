The logo was designed using the online tool at https://www.pixilart.com/. 
This platform allows you to save the image in *.pixil format. 
Once the logo design is completed, I export it in *.png format. 
Subsequently, I convert it to the *.ico format using another online 
tool at https://cloudconvert.com/.
